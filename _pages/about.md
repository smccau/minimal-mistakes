excerpt:

I am Samuel McCauley, a first-year Ph.D. student in [the Tank Lab](http://davetank.github.io/tank-lab/), located in [the Department of Biological Sciences](https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/biology) at [the University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu). 

Here you will find information about my [research interests](https://smccau.github.io/research/), as well as a [resources](https://smccau.github.io/resources/) page that seeks to synthesize and layman-ize information about comparative method packages.

## About Me
While I currently live in Idaho, I am from the great state of South Carolina, and am an alumnus of [the South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics](https://www.scgssm.org).  My experience at GSSM proved to be foundational in my current passion of organismal biology and phylogenetics.

I graduated with a B.A. in Biology from [the College of Charleston Honors College](http://honors.cofc.edu), *summa cum laude*. For my Honors Thesis, I worked with [Dr. Daniel McGlinn](http://mcglinn.web.unc.edu) to uncover the spatial and environmental drivers of beta diversity in longleaf pine (*Pinus palustris*) forests from Georgia to North Carolina.  

I am now a first-year Ph.D. student in the Tank lab at the University of Idaho.  Broadly, I am interested in how geographical movement and trait evolution influence each other, and synergistically drive diversification dynamics.  Read more in-depth about my research and study system in my [research interests](https://smccau.github.io/research/).

Outside of academia, my hobbies include photography, reading, dumping hundreds of dollars into local coffee shops, and botanizing.  My current reading adventure is Robert Jordan's *The Wheel of Time* series (on book four of fourteen).
