Thanks for checking out my site!  

I am Samuel McCauley, a first-year Ph.D. student in [the Tank Lab](http://davetank.github.io/tank-lab/), located in [the Department of Biological Sciences](https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/biology) at [the University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu). 

Here you will find information about my [research interests](https://smccau.github.io/research/), as well as a [resources](https://smccau.github.io/resources/) page that seeks to synthesize and layman-ize information about comparative method packages.
