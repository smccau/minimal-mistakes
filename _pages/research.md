On this page you will find a rather broad overview of my research interests -- just enough to get your feet wet and get a feel for what I think about every day when it comes to plants.  On the left is a collection of links to a more in-depth discussion of my research interests (_under construction electronically and mentally_).

## Study System

### _Thalictrum_

My work is based in meadow-rues (_Thalictrum_, Ranunculaceae), a relatively large (~196 species) genus of charismatic buttercups.  Meadow-rues prove to be an interesting study system for several reasons:

1. Meadow-rues are nearly fully sampled, and therefore have the potential for a complete phylogeny.
2. Meadow-rues show several (and repeated) geographical transitions.
3. Meadow-rues also show instability in sexual traits, like sexual system and pollination syndrome.

**These reasons set meadow-rues up as an ideal case to study how plants evolve when they move to new areas -- a key question in evolutionary biology.**

## Areas of Study

With meadow-rues in mind, I hope to tackle the following ideas.

### Biogeography



### Sexual Trait Evolution

### Diversification
